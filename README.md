i made this Voting POLL for my college's freshers party for the selections of Mr/Ms fresher with fair audiences poll! with voting system no unfair method were practiced because every decisions were made with considering auidence's opinion! person with majority votes will only win!


## About The UI
I tried to keep the UI clean and simple cos i'm more inclined towards minimalism, used colors which went well the fresher party theme! kept it really nice and simple!

### Results
got an overwhelming response which tbh i wasn't expecting! voting polls were open for only 3mins and more than 800 votes were counted which was kinda insane response!
